---------requête Drupal:--------------

In this query, there are two conditions,
 it seems that the default relation between them is an 'AND'.
 So we test the value 'true' at 'PUBLISHED' (= 1) and the
 value 'page at column' type '.

SELECT * FROM node WHERE type='page' AND PUBLISHED=1

--------------requête Doctrine:--------------

No action is specified, it must be a 'SELECT'.
The 'andwhere' and 'orwhere prepare the conditions, and the
'setparameter' seem to define them.

SELECT * FROM country WHERE ids IN (1,2) 
OR WHERE population > 1000
